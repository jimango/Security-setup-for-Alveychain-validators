# Security-setup-for-Alveychain-validators
## UPDATE

I have made my new custom setup instructions here:

https://github.com/jimango/alveychain-validator-extended-guide

The new instructions also contain the original tutorial to set up the validator. By doing this people with no earlier skills in linux or servers will be able to see all the basics at the same location.
